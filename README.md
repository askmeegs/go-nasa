# Mars Today 

What is happening on Mars today? (built with Go)

## Brainstorming 

"Today" is a loose term because today on earth is not the same as a Mars day (Sol), a mars day is ~1 hour longer than an earth day, so they don't line up. Also it takes 20 hours for mars lander data to travel to Earth.

InSight lander data - today's temperature, wind, pressure.
